Employed PCA to analyse image data (the Fashion-MNIST1 data set of images was used
â€“ there are 10 classes, 2 6000 training samples and 1000 test samples per class) and explored 
classification of image data with logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM) and visualisation of decision regions. 
Then, clustered the natural language from a given speech sample by K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and GMMs.
